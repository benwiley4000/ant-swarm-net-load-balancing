Algorithm Description

Schoonderwoerd et al. characterize an ant-based control (ABC) system as follows:• Ants are regularly launched with random destinations on every part of the system.• Ants walk randomly according to probabilities in pheromone tables for their particular destination.• Ants update the probabilities in the pheromone table for the location they were launched from, by increasing the probability of selection of their previous location by subsequent ants.• The increase in these probabilities is a decreasing function of the age of the ant, and of the original probability.• This probability increase could also be a function of penalties or rewards the ant has gathered on its way.• The ants get delayed on parts of the system that are heavily used.• The ants could eventually be penalised or rewarded as a function of local system utilisation.• To avoid overtraining through freezing of pheromone trails, some noise can be added to thebehaviour of the ants.

Methodology
-use BT network as example
-coded in python
-specify parameters
-outputs GML graph code, visualized in Cytoscape

Results
-graphs for ant and BFS for: 0, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000
-number of dropped and successful calls for each

Conclusion
-we were successful in implementing the algorithm
-possible extensions
——different network topologies
——non-uniform node capacities
——different call table options (ours assumed any node could call any other node with equal likelihood, but perhaps we use a call frequency table to introduce bias)
