The purpose of this project is to implement a swarm intelligence algorithm in order to solve load balancing in communications networks. We aim to reproduce the experiments of Schoonderwoerd et al., and compare their decentralized call routing algorithm’s performance with routing using a shortest path (breadth-first search) algorithm and a minimum-weight algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm). The decentralized algorithm mimics the swarm behavior of an ant colony, and uses roaming, ant-like agents which drop probability “pheromones” on nodes in order to influence the travel behavior of fellow ants and to regulate the paths of calls made across the network. Each algorithm is evaluated on the basis of the number of calls dropped. Ignoring time complexity, Dijkstra performed best, followed by the ant-based algorithm and then breadth-first search.
