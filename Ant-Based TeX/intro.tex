\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

When researching for this project, we were interested in finding a context in which using swarm intelligence algorithms was a good option, and not just an algorithm that could be adapted in order to solve the given problem. In doing so, we came across the paper by Schoonderwoerd et al. and became interested in the ant-based approach to balance communications networks.\\

Because usage of telecommunications networks is increasing, this problem is very important. Managing load by efficiently and effectively distributing load across a network, especially with the ability to route around congested nodes of the network, is crucial in order to keep the network performing as it should. \\
