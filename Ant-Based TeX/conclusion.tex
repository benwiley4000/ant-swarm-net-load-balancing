The ant-based algorithm performs much better than breadth-first search, but does not perform as well as in the results found by Schoonderwoerd et al. However, Dijkstra’s Algorithm outperforms both our implementation of the ant-based algorithm (by nearly a factor of 50) as well as that implemented by Schooderwoerd et al. (by close to a factor of 20). Because of this, Dijkstra’s Algorithm seems to be the best choice to load balance networks (ignoring considerations of time complexity).\\

There are three extensions to this algorithm we would like to explore in the future. First, we would like to test this algorithm on other network topologies. Secondly, implementing a call frequency table to allow specific source nodes to call certain destination nodes more often than others would render a more realistic simulation of how calls are generally placed. Finally, we think it would be interesting to try the same experiment with non-uniform maximum node capacities.
