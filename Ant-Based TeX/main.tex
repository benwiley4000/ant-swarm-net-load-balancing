\maketitle % formats the title nicely, do not modify

% While at this point you could just begin your write-up, often, it's
% useful to write each section of your write-up in a separate tex
% file (not unlike the modular decomposition you do for code you
% write). These \input commands insert the contents of the
% specified tex files in the order specified. Every write-up you
% submit must contain the following sections, in the shown order. Open
% each of the indicated tex files to understand what goes in each
% section, as well as for more TeX tips.
